# Movie-Review-Classifier-and-Rating-Predictor
A ML and DL based project that classifies the reviews of a movie as positive or negative and can also predict rating of the movie based on the reviews.
Used NLTK (most powerful library for NLP) to preprocess the movie rewiews.
Performed Tokenization, Stopwords removal and Stemming in preprocessing the reviews.
Used Bernoulli Naïve Bayes, Multinomial Naïve Bayes and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models.
Plotted Confusion Matrix to compare these models and then reported the best model with highest accuracy and used the same to predict rating of the movie.
